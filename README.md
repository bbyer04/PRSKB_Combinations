The Polygenic Risk Scores Combinations Project is one we started in August 2023. In this repository, you will find the code we used to clean the data we aqcuired using the Polygenic Risk Scores Knowledge Base and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The primary aim of this project is to show that combining polygenic risk scores across multiple genome-wide association studies is better at predicting risk for a complex disorder. Our disease of interest is Alzheimer's disease.
The Polygenic Risk Scores Knowledge Base is an online or CLI polygenic risk scores calculator.
